tower-of-babel
================

tower-of-babel will show you through a series of exercises that introduce you to ES6 features.
This exercises use [babel](http://babeljs.io/). babel allows you to write code with ES6 syntax.

note: sorry for this module is Japanese only, currently. I would like to translate the problems to English and Japanese exercise will move to `tower-of-babel-jp`
